# Overview
## Abstract


The SWIM package is an efficient sensitivity analysis tool for stochastic models developed in @Pesenti2019. It provides a stressed version of a stochastic model, subject to model components (random variables) fulfilling given probabilistic constraints (stresses). Possible constraints include stressing moments, propability intervals and risk measures such as the Value-at-Risk and the Expected Shortfall. Provided with simulated scenarios from a stochastic model, the SWIM package returns scenario weights under which the stochastic model satisfies the stress and minimises the relative entropy with respect to the baseline model. 



## Background
