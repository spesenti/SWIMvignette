# Conclusion and future work

The **SWIM** package enables users to perform flexible and efficient sensitivity analyses of simulation models, using the method of stressing model components by re-weighting simulated scenarios. Multiple possibilities were demonstrated, from prioritising risk factors via reverse stress testing, to evaluating the impact on a portfolio distribution of increasing the probability of subportfoliosâ€™ joint exceedances. The implemented analysis and visualisation tools help users derive insights into their models and perform formal comparisons of the importance of model components. Since **SWIM** does not require re-simulation from the model, these sensitivity analyses have a low computational cost; moreover, they can be performed on black-box models. 

While working with a single set of simulated scenarios is computationally efficient, it also poses some limitations, as **SWIM** cannot currently consider states of the world outside those already generated by the simulation model. This places a constraint on how different the baseline and stressed model can be; technically speaking the latter must be absolutely continuous with respect to the former. We aim to address this limitation in the future, for example by allowing users to augment a given set of simulated scenarios with additional ones and/or to consider more than one set of scenarios as part of a single sensitivity analysis. 

A different issue emanating from working with a limited set of scenarios relates to the impact of sampling error on estimates of stressed distributions and sensitivity measures. Substantial sampling errors may occur in cases where users specify stresses that are technically feasible, but concentrate a lot of weight on only a few scenarios. In future updates of the package we intend to implement relevant warnings, as well as bootstrap estimates of confidence intervals for key **SWIM** outputs. 

Furthermore, future work includes enhancing analysis tools, for example functions that will make it easier to extract distributional characteristics of stressed models -- e.g. a `stressed_cor` function that enables the monitoring of correlation changes when models are stressed.
