# Conclusion and future work

The **SWIM** package enables users to perform flexible and efficient sensitivity analyses of simulation models, using the method of stressing model components by re-weighting simulated scenarios. Multiple possibilities were demonstrated, from prioritising risk factors via reverse stress testing, to evaluating the impact on a portfolio distribution of increasing the probability of subportfoliosâ€™ joint exceedances. The implemented analysis and visualisation tools help users derive insights into their models and perform formal comparisons of the importance of model components. Since **SWIM** does not require re-simulation from the model, these sensitivity analyses have a low computational cost; moreover, they can be performed on black-box models. 

Future work includes enhancing analysis tools, for example functions that will make it easier to extract distributional characteristics of stressed models -- e.g. a `stressed_cor` function that enables the monitoring of correlation changes when models are stressed. Furthermore, we consider including alternative ways of calculating scenario weights, such as minimising the $\chi^2$ divergence instead of the Kullback-Leiber divergence.
