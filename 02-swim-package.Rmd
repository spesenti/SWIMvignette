## Stressing a model {#Rfunctions}

While the SWIM package is designed to work on (Monte Carlo) realisations of model components, the scenario weights are derived in a general probabilistic framework. A baseline probability (representing the equiprobable Monte Carlo simulations) can be described by a probability measure $P$, and a stressed model by a different probabitlity measures $Q$. The stressed model is uniquely described by the change from the baseline to the stressed model, which can be seen as the scenario weights $W= \frac{dQ}{dP}$. A stressed model, under which the distribution of the model components fulfil specific stresses, is chosen such that the distortion to the baseline model is as small as possible in the Kullback-Leibler divergence (or relative entropy). Mathematically, a stressed model is the solutions to.
\begin{equation} 
\min_{ W } ~E(W \log (W)), \quad
\text{subject to constraints of the model components under } P^W.
(\#eq:optimisation)
\end{equation}
Subsequently, we denote by a superscript $W$ the quantity of interest under the stressed model, such as $P^W, ~ E^W$ for the probabtility distribution and expectation under the stressed model, respectivley. We refer to @Pesenti2019 and references therein for further mathematical details and the derivations of solutions to \@ref(eq:optimisation).


The subsequent table is a collection of all implemented types of stresses. The pricise constraints of \@ref(eq:optimisation) are explained below.

| R function         | Stress                                | `type`  |  Reference  
| :------------------| :------------------------------------ |:--------|:------------------ 
| `stress()`         | wrapper for the `stress_type` functions   |         | Section \@ref(Rstress)
| `stress_user()`    | user defined scenario weights         |`user`   |
| `stress_prob()`    | disjoint intervals                    |`prob`   | \@ref(eq:optimisationprob)

### The `stress` function and the `SWIM` object {#Rstress}
The `stress()` function is a wapper for the `stress_` functions, with `stress(type = "type", ... )` and `stress_type(...)` being equivalent. The `stress()` function solves optimisation \@ref(eq:optimisation) for constraints specified through `type`and returns a `SWIM` object containing a list of:

| | |
| :---           | :--- |       
| `x`            | realistaions of the model  |
| `new_weights`  | scenario weights |
| `type`         | "type" of stress |
| `specs`        | details about the stress |

The data frame, `x` in the above table, containing the realisations of the baseline model, can be extracted from a `SWIM` object using `get_data()`. Similarly, `get_weights()` and `get_weightsfun()` provide the scenario weights, respectively the functions, that when applied to `x` generate the scenarion weights. The specification of the applied stress can be obtained using `get_specs()`.

### Stressing disjoint probability intervals 

Stressing disjoint probability intervals, allows to define stresses by altering regions or events of a model component. The scenario weights are calculated via `stress_prob()`, or equivalently `stress(type = "prob", ...)`, and the stressed probability intervals are specified through the `lower` and `upper` endpoints of the intervals.


> For disjoint intervals $B_1, \ldots, B_I$ with $P(X \in B_i) >0$, for all $i = 1, \ldots, I$, and $\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_I > 0$ such that $\alpha_1 + \ldots  + \alpha_I < 1$, `stress_prob()` solves for the constraints
\begin{equation} 
P^W(X \in B_i) = \alpha_i, ~i = 1, \ldots, I. (\#eq:optimisationprob)
\end{equation}



### Stressing moments 



The functions `stress_mean()`, `stress_mean_sd()` and `stress_moment()` can be applied to multiple model components and are the only `stress` functions that have scenrio weights calculated via numerical optimisation using the [nleqslv](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nleqslv) package. Thus, dependending on the choice of moment stresses, existence of a stressed model is not guaranteed. 

> For $i = 1, \ldots, I$ with $J_i \subset \{1, \ldots, n\}$ and functions $f_i \colon \mathbb{R}^{J_i} \to \mathbb{R}$, `stress_moment()` solves for the constraints
\begin{equation} 
E^W(f_i(X_{J_i}) ) = m_i, ~i = 1, \ldots, I. (\#eq:optimisationmoment)
\end{equation}



### Stressing risk measures

The functions `stress_VaR` and `stress_VaR_ES` provides stressed models, under which a model components fulfils a stress on the Value-at-Risk ($\text{VaR}$) and/or Expected Shortfall ($\text{ES}$) risk measures. The $\text{VaR}$ at level $0 < \alpha < 1$ of a random variable $Z$ with distrbution $F$, is defined as the $\alpha-$quantile of $F$, that is $$\text{VaR}_\alpha(Z) = F^{-1}(\alpha).$$ The $\text{ES}$ at level $0 < \alpha < 1$ of a random variable $Z$ is given by $$\text{ES}_\alpha(Z) = \int_0^1 \text{VaR}_u(Z) \mathrm{d}u.$$


> For $0< \alpha <1$ and $q, s \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\text{VaR}_{\alpha}(Y)<q < s$, `stress_VaR()` solves for the constraints
\begin{equation} 
\text{VaR}_{\alpha }^W(Y) = q;  (\#eq:optimisationVaR)
\end{equation}
and `stress_VaR_ES()` solves for the constraints
\begin{equation}                                                
\text{VaR}_{\alpha }^W(Y) = q, \text{ ES}_{\alpha }^W(Y) = s.(\#eq:optimisationVaRES)
\end{equation}




## Analysis of stressed models

The function `summary()` is a methods for an object of class SWIM and provides summary statistics of the baseline and stressed models. If the SWIM object contains more than one set of scenario weights, each corresponding to one stressed model, the `stress()` function returns for each set of scenarion weights a list containting:    

|                | |
| :---           | :--- |  
|`mean`          |sample mean
|`sd`            |sample standard deviation
|`skewness`      |sample skewness
|`ex kurtosis`   |sample excess kurtosis
|`1st Qu.`       |25% quantile
|`Median`        |median, 50% quantile
|`3rd Qu.`       |75% quantile

The empirical distribution functions of model components under a stressed model can be calculated by evaluation of `cdf()` on a SWIM object. It is important to note, that the standard empirical distribution function, `ecdf()` applied to a SWIM object will **not** return empirical distribution functions under a stressed model. Similarly, to calculate sample quantiles of stressed models components, the function `quantile_stressed()` should be used. Implemented visualisation of distribution functions are `plot_cdf()`, for plotting empirical distribution functions, and `plot_hist()`, for plotting histograms of model components under stressed models.

Comparison of baseline and stressed models and how stressed model impact model components, can be done via the `sensitivity()` function. The implemented sensitivity measures are summarised in the table below. The Wasserstein and Kolmogorov, sensitivities are to compare stressed (and baseline) models, as these sensitivities only depend on the scenario weights, whereas the Gamma sensitivity is useful to compare the impact of a stress model on the model components.

|                |                  |
| :---           | :--- | :--- | 
|Wasserstein   |$\int | F^W_X (x) - F_X(x)| dx$ | comparing models
|Kolmogorov    |$\sup_x |F^W_X (x) - F_X(x)|$ | comparing models
|Gamma         |$\frac{E^W(X) - E(X)}{c}$, for a normalisation $c$ | comparing model components

The normalisation for the Gamma sensitivity is such that Gamma takes values between -1 and 1, where positive values correspond to a larger impact on a larger impact. The sensitivities of model components can be plotted using `plot_sensitivity()`. The function `importance_rank()`, returns the effective rank of model component according ot the chosen sensitivity measures.
